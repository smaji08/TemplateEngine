# TemplateEngine
A Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

### Feature

The application will be invoked with the following command:
`<node app.js>`

### Feature

The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment passes all basic unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

### User Story

AS a manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

### My Experience
Though each steps had its own challenges, generating the output html using template literals was the most challanging part for me. After reading and watching some videos, I could figure out how to proceed further and yes, I am quite awed by the possibilities of template literals.
